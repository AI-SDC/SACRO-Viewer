Welcome to SACRO Viewer
=======================

SACRO Viewer is a desktop application designed for reviewing research outputs produced using the `ACRO <https://github.com/AI-SDC/ACRO>`_ tools. It provides a graphical user interface that enables output checkers to efficiently review files, researcher comments, and statistical analysis outcomes in a secure environment.

What is SACRO Viewer?
=====================

SACRO Viewer serves as the final step in the statistical disclosure control workflow. After researchers have used ACRO tools to analyze their data and generate outputs with privacy assessments, SACRO Viewer allows authorized personnel to:

* Review each output file individually
* Examine ACRO's statistical disclosure control assessments
* Read researcher comments and justifications
* Make informed approve/reject decisions
* Generate secure release packages containing only approved outputs

The application is specifically designed to work in Trusted Research Environments (TREs) where internet connectivity may be limited or restricted, ensuring that sensitive research outputs can be reviewed securely.

Key Features
============

**Desktop Application**
  Runs locally on Windows, Linux, and macOS without requiring internet connectivity or external services.

**ACRO Integration**
  Automatically detects and loads JSON metadata generated by ACRO tools, providing seamless integration with the existing workflow.

**Comprehensive File Support**
  Displays various file types including CSV tables, images (PNG, JFIF), text files, and JSON data with appropriate formatting.

**Statistical Context**
  Shows ACRO analysis results including disclosure risk assessments, cell suppression information, and privacy protection status.

**Review Workflow**
  Provides an intuitive interface for reviewing outputs with clear approve/reject options and comment fields for reviewer feedback.

**Secure Release**
  Generates zipfiles containing only approved outputs along with metadata describing the release for audit purposes.

**Audit Trail**
  Maintains records of all approval decisions and reviewer comments for compliance and auditing requirements.

How It Works
============

SACRO Viewer operates on directories containing research outputs that have been processed by ACRO tools. The typical workflow involves:

1. **Loading Outputs**: The application scans a directory for ACRO metadata (typically ``outputs.json``) and associated output files.

2. **Automatic Detection**: If no ACRO metadata is found, the viewer automatically generates metadata for all files in the directory, treating them as "custom" outputs requiring review.

3. **File Review**: Each output is displayed with its associated metadata, including:
   - ACRO status (pass/fail/review)
   - Statistical analysis results
   - Researcher comments
   - File checksums for integrity verification

4. **Decision Making**: Reviewers can approve or reject each output individually, adding their own comments as needed.

5. **Release Generation**: Once all outputs have been reviewed, approved files can be packaged into a secure release zipfile.

Target Users
============

SACRO Viewer is designed for:

* **Output Checkers**: Personnel responsible for reviewing research outputs before release from secure environments
* **Data Managers**: Staff overseeing the statistical disclosure control process in research institutions
* **TRE Administrators**: Technical staff managing Trusted Research Environments who need to facilitate secure output review

The application requires no programming knowledge and provides a user-friendly graphical interface suitable for non-technical users while maintaining the security and audit requirements of research environments.
